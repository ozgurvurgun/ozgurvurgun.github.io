I do not want to left my whole life behind and start a completely new thing. I&rsquo;m 30+. I feel my-self tired to start a new life. But in same time i am not sure about it.</p><p>Maybe it&rsquo;ll be better to future myself. I worry about my country and i have no chance to change something in here. I feel myself powerless. I feel myself useless. I cannot see any possibility about our country&rsquo;s future. I have no hope in a short period.</p><p>Of course, in a time, people my country and the country will rise, but i do not believe that i&rsquo;ll live enough to see that :)</p><p>Anyway, i have to make a decision for my future in a few years.
