The Promise of Unity
The concept of Beeper, a one-stop-shop for all messaging apps, is a compelling one. However, as I realized(finally lol), each messaging app has its unique features that make it special. Translating these unique features into a single app is a Herculean task, and it&rsquo;s understandable if some features get lost in translation."><meta property="og:image" content><meta property="og:title" content="A journey with beeper the all in one messaging app"><meta property="og:description" content="Recently, I embarked on a journey with Beeper, an app that promises to unify all your messaging applications into one.

The idea of having a single hub for all my conversations was intriguing, and I was eager to see how it would pan out. Here are my thoughts after a few weeks of using Beeper.</p><h2 id=the-promise-of-unity>The Promise of Unity</h2><p>The concept of Beeper, a one-stop-shop for all messaging apps, is a compelling one. However, as I realized(finally lol), each messaging app has its unique features that make it special. Translating these unique features into a single app is a Herculean task, and it&rsquo;s understandable if some features get lost in translation.</p><h2 id=the-beeper-experience>The Beeper Experience</h2><h3 id=telegram-on-beeper>Telegram on Beeper</h3><p>I started my Beeper journey on my Mac, integrating it first with Telegram. It was a breeze to see all my message history and groups in one place. However, I missed some of Telegram&rsquo;s unique features like group searching, group detail view, adding users to groups, and sharing group links. As a result, I found myself keeping Telegram installed alongside Beeper.</p><h3 id=whatsapp-on-beeper>WhatsApp on Beeper</h3><p>Next, I integrated WhatsApp. While the basic messaging function worked well, I found that video-audio chats, status shares, and separated views for files and media were missing. This meant that I had to keep WhatsApp installed as well.</p><h3 id=android-sms-gateway-on-beeper>Android SMS Gateway on Beeper</h3><p>When I integrated the Android SMS gateway, I had to install Beeper on my phone. It was convenient to have all my integrations on my phone, but I soon noticed that I was receiving duplicate notifications - one from Beeper and one from the original app. This was a bit overwhelming, and I found no way to disable notifications by integration. However, I didn&rsquo;t want to disable all Beeper notifications as it had become my default SMS app.</p><h3 id=slack-on-beeper>Slack on Beeper</h3><p>Integrating Slack brought a unique challenge. Finding the right Slack group via search in Beeper was tricky, as it always included &ldquo;slackbot&rdquo; as a second user in the chat. For instance, if I searched for &ldquo;Daniel,&rdquo; I would see &ldquo;Daniel & Slackbot.&rdquo; This was a bit confusing. Additionally, I missed the thread feature that Slack offers.</p><h3 id=discord-on-beeper>Discord on Beeper</h3><p>Finally, when I integrated Discord, I had to bid farewell to audio chats, a key feature of Discord that I use frequently.</p><h2 id=the-verdict>The Verdict</h2><p>In summary, while Beeper&rsquo;s mission to assemble all messaging apps into one is ambitious and innovative, it still has some way to go in terms of UI/UX. The Beeper inbox tends to get crowded quickly, making it easy to lose track of conversations.</p><h2 id=suggestions-for-beeper>Suggestions for Beeper</h2><p>Despite my decision to stop using Beeper for now, I believe in its potential and look forward to future updates. Here are a few suggestions for the Beeper team:</p><ol><li>Consider allowing users to disable notifications by integration to avoid notification overload.</li><li>Improve the search function, especially for Slack integration, to make it more user-friendly.</li><li>Work towards integrating more features from the original apps, like audio chats for Discord and group details for Telegram.</li></ol><p>Beeper is a step towards a future where we can manage all our conversations in one place. With some improvements, it could become a game-changer in the world of messaging apps.</p></section><div class=post-tags></div></div></div></article></main><footer><div style=display:flex><a class=soc href=https://github.com/ozgurvurgun rel=me title=GitHub><i data-feather=github></i></a>
