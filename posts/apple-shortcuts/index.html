Apple announces an application named Shortcuts. I am a person who has an obsession with automation. And I loved it. I tried to use it for several purposes.
I wanted to add a shortcut for translating selected text to Turkish. There is a built-in translate app in macOS but there is no Turkish support, unfortunately. So, I decided to create a new shortcut for that task."><meta property="og:image" content><meta property="og:title" content="Apple shortcuts"><meta property="og:description" content="I have a MacBook as a backup computer.

Not much.</p><p>I reviewed a few shortcut snippets and finally got it how can I do that?</p><p>The magic part is getting a text from the selection. I used to use X clipboard to do that in Linux but I do not want to spend time finding an equivalent version on mac. There is an action in the Shortcut app as named Share under the Sharing category.</p><p>I did use that as the entry point, limited it with text type, and use Quick Menu as the input source. Then I set a variable named $query and combine the query variable with the URL <a href="https://translate.google.com/?text=$query">https://translate.google.com/?text=$query</a>, and finally, I added Open action with that value.</p><p>It is not easy to tell that in words. Let me share a screen. (Eventually, it&rsquo;s visual programming)</p><p><img src=http://historyofart.emre.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Screen-Shot-2022-08-28-at-19.24.50.png alt></p><p>Then I went to System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Services section. And find my shortcut and added keyboard shortcuts for the service.</p><p>Now I can select any text in any document then I need just press the option+command+T and it will open the correct URL with the selected word.</p></section><div class=post-tags></div></div></div></article></main><footer><div style=display:flex><a class=soc href=https://github.com/ozgurvurgun rel=me title=GitHub><i data-feather=github></i></a>
