The article was full of details and descriptions. The author didn&amp;rsquo;t give a strict definition of what emojis are and suggested that everyone can have their own idea about them.
After thinking about it, I came up with my own definition.
To me, emojis are like emotional signs that we use in communication alongside letters. This definition excludes other types of visual languages, like hieroglyphics, which are pictures or symbols representing words.</description></item></channel></rss>
