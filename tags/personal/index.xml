It was the time for that. I was feel that. So I decide to not smoke anymore and i didn&amp;rsquo;t, i will not. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to smoke anymore, i did for 12 years and it is enough. I want to live healthy, i want to breath to fresh air.
These are my advises to who wants to quit;
Do not push yourself; at first, you have to accept the smoking is wrong, otherwise you can not leave it.</description></item></channel></rss>
